## Hi internet! :fire:

My name is **Facundo Turiaci** and I'm a **Software Developer**.

I have worked as **Front End** :computer: and also as **Game Developer** :video_game:, I really enjoy both of them, but lately I'm really focused in **Web Developing**. 

I am a music enthusiast, I enjoy my free time playing (guitar, bass, drums, piano...) ðŸŽ¸ :guitar: 

I also love b series or horror movies :movie_camera:
